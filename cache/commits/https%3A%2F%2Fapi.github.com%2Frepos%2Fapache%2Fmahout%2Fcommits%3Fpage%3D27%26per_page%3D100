One of the possible side-effects of completing an iteration is that it persists\nstate to disk (or HDFS, etc).  When the solver is started up, and passed the path to the intermediate\nstate and there is already state persisted there, it picks up where it left off.\n\n  This additionally improves scalability for the solver, by not requring more than 3 singular vectors\nto be held in memory at any one time, instead of 2*desiredRank dense vectors of this size.\n\n  This API change to LanczosSolver is non-backwards compatible, but hopefully moving to a single \npackaged state object will make it less likely that this kind of change will be needed much in the\nfuture on this class.\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/mahout/trunk@1100042
