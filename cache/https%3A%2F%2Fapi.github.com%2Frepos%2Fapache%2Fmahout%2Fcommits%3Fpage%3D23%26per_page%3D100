This will involve removing a lot of existing driver, mapper and reducer code and many time-consuming unit tests. It will also have some impact on other components as the representation of clusters in the file system changes from Cluster to self-describing ClusterWritable.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/mahout/trunk@1298625 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"4479214d96c9f9d9004e5dc64298ed2304a48ccb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/git/trees/4479214d96c9f9d9004e5dc64298ed2304a48ccb"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/git/commits/3eba6f26486dcb9e2ec03702b60a38de399e738f","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/3eba6f26486dcb9e2ec03702b60a38de399e738f","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mahout/commit/3eba6f26486dcb9e2ec03702b60a38de399e738f","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/3eba6f26486dcb9e2ec03702b60a38de399e738f/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mahout/commit/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696"}]},{"sha":"d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjAwODk4NTk6ZDM2NDc0OGM3NGQxZGRhMzNjNDEzY2M3ZjNmM2Y4Njk0M2Q3NzY5Ng==","commit":{"author":{"name":"pranjan","email":"pranjan@unknown","date":"2012-03-08T14:31:39Z"},"committer":{"name":"pranjan","email":"pranjan@unknown","date":"2012-03-08T14:31:39Z"},"message":"MAHOUT-982, Formatted few newly added lines.\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/mahout/trunk@1298408 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","tree":{"sha":"e5de303e20e9317c5219905c63ce6e8cacbc7270","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/git/trees/e5de303e20e9317c5219905c63ce6e8cacbc7270"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/git/commits/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mahout/commit/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/d364748c74d1dda33c413cc7f3f3f86943d77696/comments","author":null,"committer":null,"parents":[{"sha":"a93745846d1fb5b41af5f1e33810cefb9f0806f7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mahout/commits/a93745846d1fb5b41af5f1e33810cefb9f0806f7","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mahout/commit/a93745846d1fb5b41af5f1e33810cefb9f0806f7"}]},{"sha":"a93745846d1fb5b41af5f1e33810cefb9f0806f7","node_id":"MDY6Q29tbWl0MjAwODk4NTk6YTkzNzQ1ODQ2ZDFmYjViNDFhZjVmMWUzMzgxMGNlZmI5ZjA4MDZmNw==","commit":{"author":{"name":"pranjan","email":"pranjan@unknown","date":"2012-03-08T14:24:18Z"},"committer":{"name":"pranjan","email":"pranjan@unknown","date":"2012-03-08T14:24:18Z"},"message":"MAHOUT-982, Clustering vectors using ClusterClassificationDriver.
