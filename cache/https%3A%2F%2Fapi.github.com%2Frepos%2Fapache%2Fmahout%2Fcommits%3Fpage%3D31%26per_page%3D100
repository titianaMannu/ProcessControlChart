refactors Cluster to inherit from Model<VectorWritable> instead of AbstractCluster\nwhich now inherits just Cluster. The existing Dirichlet models also now inherit from Cluster, simplifying the use\nof generics and cleaning up a lot of the code.\n\nSince Dirichlet now can iterate over arbitrary Clusters as its models, this opens up the entire set of DistanceMeasure\nbased clusters for Dirichlet processing. This should allow the output of e.g. Canopy to become the prior model\ndistribution in a subsequent Dirichlet step. Is this a feature?\n\nThe AbstractCluster hierarchy has been adjusted allowing GaussianClusterDistribution and \nDistanceMeasureClusterDistribution to instantiate its subclasses. Both have tests and seem to work as expected.\n\nAll unit tests run.
